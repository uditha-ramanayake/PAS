# 📌 PAS - Blind Matching Project Approval System

## 📖 Overview

The **Project Approval System (PAS)** is a secure web-based application designed to match student research project proposals with academic supervisors using a **Blind Matching mechanism**.

The system ensures fairness by hiding student identities during the initial selection phase and revealing them only after a supervisor confirms a match.
